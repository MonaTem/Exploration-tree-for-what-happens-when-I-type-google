# About

This is an attempt at collaborative answering the famous question 

>"What happens when you type google.com into your browser's address box and press enter?" 

with an emphasis on explorative learning. Instead of having a linear list of micro bullet points, which can easily overwhelm the reader, the aim is to build a tree anyone can travel at the choosen level of explanations. The reader can go deeper or shallower when he wants. 

# Why I love this question

I have been asked this questions in interviews, and I have asked it multiple times. I love it because you get to test technical knowledge and people skills that way. You get to know what candidates know and how they communicate it, but also how they react when they don't know ! There is no "right" answer to the question,because there is no "right" level of detail, that explains everything. We can keep going infinitely more into detail, explaining each step in more and more detail.  Still, the way you address the question tells a lot about you !

It's easy to keep on going deep until the candidates have to say "I don't know how that part works"; if someone knows what they don't know, they will know when to ask questions, but if they just make stuff up to try to make themselves sound more knowledgeable, I don't know if I could ever trust their knowledge or judgement because it could be based on them just covering up a lack of knowledge about something.   Keep in mind that if I wanted a processor engineer, I'd be looking for a different answer than a web developer, or a networking guy, etc. Essentially anyone involved in the modern world of IT has to be able to answer something they're good at - and more importantly, admit the parts they don't understand.

Another thing that I really like about it is that the question provides the contexte to start a real coversation with the interviewee. When he stalls, it's easy to ask questions to go deeper, or ask questions to move to another branch... 

- General understanding of the broad picture of internet and computers ? does they have enough experience that they have done at least some looking into how the stack works enough to discuss it intelligently ?
- Ability to question the question, and adapt the level of description to the interviewer. Can this person summarize a technical issue in a comprehensible way for the audience? Will he be confused about what level of detail should be supplied ?  Are they are capable of breaking down and explaining a complex piece of technology with several interacting parts.
- identify the edge of the technical knowledge of the interviewee ? How sharp are your skills ?
- which part you go into detail on is a pretty good indication where your strengths lie.
- Does 
  - does the interviewee rushes trhrough a specific part, neglecting other parts ? 
  
  
 # A suggestion to tackle it
  
  I think answering it with a general overview, and then optionally going into more detail based on feedback from the person you're explaining it to is actually a pretty important life skill for an engineer. Going into the weeds immediately is not great when you're communicating with people at a different skill level than yourself.
