# Before
The server streamed its response to the client. [⏮](../server/index.md)

# The browser displays the page

The browser's functionality is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window. The resource is usually an HTML document, but may also be a PDF, image, or some other type of content.

The way the browser interprets and displays HTML files is specified in the HTML and CSS specifications. These specifications are maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) organization, which is the standards organization for the web.

Once the server supplies the resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) to the browser it undergoes the below process:

- Parsing - HTML, CSS, JS [(explore)](./parsing/index.md)
- Rendering - Construct DOM Tree → Render Tree → Layout of Render Tree → Painting the render tree [(explore)](./rendering/index.md)



# Next
the page is displayed, there is nothing next until the user does something. Or may be some socket / ajax calls ? some spying ?
