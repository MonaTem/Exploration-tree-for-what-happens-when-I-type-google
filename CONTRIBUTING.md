# Some rules


- In accordance with the goal of vulgarization, a node should have between 2 and 5 children. If you have more, it's probably a good idea to factorize children into a broader description, easier to understand, and make it a node for more precise children.

- use github flavored markdown (GFM)

- links should be relatives
